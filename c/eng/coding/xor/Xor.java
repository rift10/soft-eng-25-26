  // To convert a String containing a hex digit into a numeric value
  // you'll want to look up the Integer.parseInt method.
  //
  // Also I should have talked to you about the byte data type and how
  // to use the cast operator to cast an int to a byte.
  //
  // To make a String from an array of bytes (byte[]) you can use the
  // String constructor String(byte[] bytes, String enc) like:
  //
  //   new String(bytes, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
  //
  // The value 567231495 passed to the constructor is the secret key.
  // It's just a random int, i.e. 32 random bits. I produced the value
  // of CIPHERTEXT by first converting a String message to bytes via the
  // String method:
  //
  //   s.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)
  //
  // and then encoding those bytes via the same process as I described
  // above for decoding. (This is a symmetric cipher meaning encryption
  // and decryption are the same process.)
